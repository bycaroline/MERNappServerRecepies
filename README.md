- **Comments**: Users can comment on each recipe
- **CRUD**: Possible to create, list, update and delete recipes

- **Database**: MongoDB and Cloudinary for images

## Licens
Caroline Eklund holds the license. 

## Deployment
The app is currently deployed on Render for free, and therfore the loading of the app is slow at first.
